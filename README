In general, the code in this repository tries to use available 
memory bandwith in you computer to communicate information between
processes.

The sender modulates the shared resource "memory-bandwith" by 
periodicall performing memcpy like operations.

The receiver continuosly monitors the avalable memory bandwidth by 
performing memcpy-like operations and measuring the time it took.

In this example code we use frequency-shift keying (FSK) to encode bits.
